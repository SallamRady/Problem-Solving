# Array and Vector

## Array

is a collection of elements of same type placed in contiguous memory locations.

### Examples for array initialization in c++

<code>int a[10];</code>
<br/>
<code>int a[100] = {0};</code><br/>
<code>int a[10] = {1,2,3};</code><br/>
<code>int a[] = {1,2,3};</code><br/>
<code>string fruits[2] = {"apple","mango"};</code>

## Vector

- vectors are sequence containers representing arrays that can change in size.
- Just like arrays vectors use contiguous storage locations for thier elements,and access element in O(1).
<br/><code>v2[0]</code>
- But unlike an arrays thier size change dynamically with thier storage geing handled automatcally by the container.
- Unlike an arrays vectors send to function passed by value.
- Vector size tell you number of elements in array.
  <br/><code>v2.size()</code>
- Vector Capacity of vrctor tell you what is the actional memory allocated.
  <br/><code>v2.capacity()</code>
