# Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to various programming problems from platforms like Codeforces, HackerRank, and LeetCode. I use C++, JavaScript, and TypeScript to solve these problems as part of improving my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Document my solutions to programming problems.
- Serve as a reference for future problem-solving sessions.
- Track my progress in problem-solving skills over time.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- back-tracking directory for back-tracking algorithm problems solutions.
- bit-manipulation directory for bit-manipulation problems solutions.
- codeforces directory for codeforces problems solutions
- HackerRank directory for HackerRank problems solutions
- leetcode directory for leetcode problems solutions
- LinkedList directory for solutions of problems related to linked list.
- recursion directory for solutions of problems related to recursion.
- search-algorithms directory for solutions of problems related to search algorithms.
- sort-algorithms directory for solutions of problems related to sort algorithms.
